# Cat and Mouse
A game I designed and created in 2022.

## Instructions
When you start, your ball (the cat) is placed on a grid. There is a second, invisible ball on the board- the mouse. At the bottom of the screen, it says how many squares (or moves) you are away from the mouse. You use the arrow keys to move (left, right, up, down); however, each time you move a space, the mouse does as well! You win when you catch the mouse.
